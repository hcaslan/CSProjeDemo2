# Employee Payroll System

The Employee Payroll System is a Java application that manages the payroll information of employees in an organization. It calculates the monthly salary for different types of personnel, such as managers and staff members, based on their working hours, roles, and levels.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several Java classes organized into packages:

- `org.bilgeadam.data`: Contains the classes representing the employee and payroll data structures.
  - `Personel`: An abstract class representing a general employee with basic information and salary calculation logic.
  - `Yonetici`: A class extending `Personel`, representing a manager with additional properties and salary calculation logic.
  - `Memur`: A class extending `Personel`, representing a staff member with additional properties and salary calculation logic.
  - `PaymentDetail`: A class representing the details of an employee's payment, including main payment, additional payment, and total payment.
  - `MaasBordro`: A class representing a payroll document, including the payroll date and the associated employee.

- `org.bilgeadam.constant`: Contains the classes representing various constants used in the application.
  - `Role`: An enum representing the different roles of employees, such as manager and staff.
  - `MemurLevel`: An enum representing the different levels of staff members, with associated hourly rates.
  - `Month`: An enum representing the months of the year.

- `org.bilgeadam.util`: Contains utility classes used in the application.
  - `Generator`: A utility class for generating data, such as dates.
  - `OutputHelper`: A utility class for displaying output messages and writing data to JSON files.
  - `InputHelper`: A utility class for reading user input from the console and validating its format.
  - `DosyaOku`: A utility class for reading data from files.

## Usage

The main functionality of the Employee Payroll System is demonstrated through the `MaasBordro` class. Here's an overview of the key methods:

- `maasHesapla()`: This method calculates the salary for a specific employee based on their working hours, role, and level.

- `displayBordro()`: This static method displays the payroll documents for a list of employees. It categorizes the employees based on their working hours and displays appropriate messages.

- `createBordroList()`: This static method creates a list of payroll documents for a list of employees, using dates generated by the `Generator` class.

- `writeBordroToJson()`: This static method writes the payroll documents to JSON files using the `OutputHelper` class.

You can create instances of `Personel`, `Yonetici`, and `Memur` classes, set their properties, and use the methods mentioned above to calculate salaries, display payroll documents, and write them to JSON files.

## Dependencies

The Employee Payroll System has the following external dependencies:

- Gson: The Gson library is used for converting Java objects to JSON format and vice versa. It provides convenient methods for serialization and deserialization. You can download the Gson library from the official website (https://github.com/google/gson) or include it as a dependency in your build configuration.
